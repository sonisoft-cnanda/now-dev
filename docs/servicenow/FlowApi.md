## API Reference - Server Side Scoped

ServiceNow provides JavaScript APIs for use within scripts running on the ServiceNow platform to deliver common functionality. This reference lists available classes and methods along with parameters, descriptions, and examples to make extending the ServiceNow platform easier.

**Please note:** The APIs below are intended for scoped applications and may behave differently in the global scope.

# FlowAPI - Scoped, Global

The FlowAPI provides methods to execute actions, flows, or subflows in server-side scripts using either blocking or non-blocking methods.

Access FlowAPI methods in global and scoped scripts using the `sn_fd` namespace. Create calls to your flows using the Code Snippet action in Workflow Studio or use the methods detailed here to update scripts manually.

Note:In domain separated instances, flows, subflows, and
actions triggered by this API run in the domain of the user who started the script. For
example, if a user in the Acme domain starts a script that triggers a flow, the flow runs in
the Acme domain and can only access Acme data, even if the flow runs as the System User.


Note: To optimize instance performance, avoid calling these methods from an asynchronous
business rule script. Instead, create a scheduled job record within the Workflow Studio UI.

## cancel(String contextId, String reason)

Cancels a paused or running flow, subflow, or action.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contextId | String | Sys\_id of the execution details record for the flow, subflow, or action. Access the execution details by navigating to the Flow Executions tab in Workflow Studio, or pass the sys\_id of the context record returned by the startFlow(), startSubflow(), or startAction() methods.<br>Note: There might be a small delay in cancellation if<br>the target context is running on a different node of the instance. Contexts running on the<br>same node are cancelled immediately. Contexts running on another node must first wait for<br>the cancellation to be forwarded to the appropriate node. |
| reason | String | Optional. Reason for canceling the flow, subflow, or action. Appears in the<br> Message field of the Flow engine log entries \[sys\_flow\_log\]<br> table. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| void | Method does not return a value |

### Example

This uses the return value of the startFlow() method to cancel
any long-running flows.

```
(function() {

var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
now_GR.addQuery('number', 'INC0000050');
now_GR.query();
now_GR.next();

      try {
          var inputs = {};
          inputs['current'] = now_GR; // GlideRecord of table:
          inputs['table_name'] = 'incident';

          // Starts the flow asynchronously.
          var result = sn_fd.FlowAPI.getRunner()
          .flow('global.myFlow')
          .inBackground()
          .withInputs(inputs)
          .run();

          var contextId = result.getContextId();
          var dateRun = result.getDate();
          var domainUsed = result.getDomainId();
          var flowName = result.getFlowObjectName();
          var flowObjectType = result.getFlowObjectType();

      } catch (ex) {
          var message = ex.getMessage();
          gs.error(message);
      }
})();


// Call the cancel() method using the context Id returned from the startFlow() method
sn_fd.FlowAPI.cancel(contextId, 'Flow took too long to execute.');
```

### Example

This cancels any flows named Test Flow.

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord("sys_flow_context");
now_GR.addQuery("name", "Test Flow");
now_GR.query();

while (now_GR.next()) {
sn_fd.FlowAPI.cancel(now_GR.getUniqueValue(), 'Canceling Test Flows');
}
```

## executeAction(String name, Map inputs, Number timeout)

Runs an action from a server-side script synchronously.

Execute an action from within a business rule, script include, or any other server-side
script. Actions run using this method run synchronously, so the method has access to outputs
created by the action. Use startAction to run an action
asynchronously.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

Note:This method runs the action as the user who initiates
the session.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The scope and name of the action to be executed, for example<br> `global.action_name`. |
| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define action inputs. Use the input name, not the input<br> label. |
| timeout | Number | Optional. Timeout in milliseconds. This value overrides the 30<br> second default timeout specified by the<br> com.glide.hub.flow\_api.default\_execution\_time system property. After<br> the timeout expires, an exception is thrown. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | The action outputs. |

### Example

In this , the script uses sn\_fd.FlowAPI.executeAction to execute
an action called actionforpassword2test in the global scope. A variable called inputs
contains the inputs for the action. In this case, a name and password. The outputs for the
action are stored in the outputs variable, which in this case, is an encrypted password
object. The code is wrapped in a try/catch statement to capture any errors that might occur
when the flow executes.

```
(function() {

  try {
    var inputs = {};
    inputs['name'] = ; // String
    inputs['password2'] = ; // Password (2 Way Encrypted)

    // Execute Synchronously: Run in foreground. Code snippet has access to outputs.
    // var timeout = ; //timeout in ms
    //sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeAction('global.actionforpassword2test', inputs, timeout)
    var outputs = sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeAction('global.actionforpassword2test', inputs);

    // Get Outputs:
    // Note: outputs can only be retrieved when executing synchronously.
    var output = outputs['output']; // Password (2 Way Encrypted)

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  }
})();
```

## executeActionQuick(String name, Map inputs, Number timeout)

Run an action from a server-side script synchronously from the current user session
without creating execution details or other related records. Improve performance by eliminating
record-keeping overhead. Use this API to increase the speed of high-volume processing, for
example multiple executions per second, in a production environment.

Reporting & records generatedThis method does not create execution details and context records, regardless of Workflow Studio settings.Wait supportThis method does not support pausing the action to wait
for conditions. Steps that pause for wait conditions such as Ask for Approval or Wait
for Condition are not supported.MID Server supportThis method does not support pausing an action to run from a MID Server.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | Scope and internal name of the action to execute. For example,<br> `global.action_name`. Locate the Internal<br> name field in the list of Workflow Studio<br> actions. |
| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define action inputs. You can find the available action<br> inputs and required data types under Inputs in the action outline. Use the input<br> name, not the input label. For example,<br> `{'table':'incident','sys_id':'a39d8e3cf0212300964feeefe80ff0ed'}`. |
| timeout | Number | Optional. Timeout in milliseconds. This value overrides the 30<br>second default timeout specified by the<br>com.glide.hub.flow\_api.default\_execution\_time system property. After<br>the timeout expires, an exception is thrown. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Object containing outputs defined by the action. You can find the outputs for<br> the action under Outputs in the action outline. |

### Example

```
(function() {
  try {

    var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
    grIncident.get('57af7aec73d423002728660c4cf6a71c');

    var inputs = {};
    inputs['variable'] = grIncident;

    var outputs = sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeActionQuick('global.update_record_test', inputs);

    // Get Outputs:
    // Note: outputs can only be retrieved when executing synchronously.
    var output1 = outputs['output1'];

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
    }

})();
```

## executeDataStreamAction(String name, Map inputs, Number timeout)

Runs a Data Stream action synchronously from a server-side script and returns a
ScriptableDataStream object.

For more information about Data Stream actions, see Data Stream actions and
pagination.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

Note:Always wrap data stream logic in a
`try/catch` block to catch errors. Always include a
`finally` statement that ends with the close()
method from the ScriptableDataStream class to close the data
stream and prevent performance issues.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The scope and name of the Data Stream action to execute. For example,<br> `global.data_stream_action_name`. |
| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define action inputs. Use the input name, not the input<br> label. If the action does not have any inputs, do not include this<br> parameter. |
| timeout | Number | Optional. Amount of time before the action times out. After the timeout<br> expires, an exception is thrown. The timeout only applies to the<br> executeDataStreamAction method, not to methods in the<br> ScriptableDataStream class.<br>Default: 30000, specified by the<br>com.glide.hub.flow\_api.default\_execution\_time system<br>property<br>Unit: Milliseconds |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ScriptableDataStream | An object used to iterate through items in the data stream. Use the methods in<br> the ScriptableDataStream class to interact with this object. See<br> [ScriptableDataStream\<br> API](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableDataStreamAPI). |

### Example

This creates an incident record for each item returned in the data stream.

```
(function() {

  try {

    // Execute Data Stream Action.
    var stream = sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeDataStreamAction('x_my_scope.data_stream_name');

    // Process each item in the data stream
    while (stream.hasNext()) {

      // Get a single item from the data stream.
      var item = stream.next();

      // Use the item.
      var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
      now_GR.setValue('number',item.id);
      now_GR.setValue('short_description',item.name);
      now_GR.insert();

      // By default, this code snippet will terminate after 10 items.
      // Remove or modify this limit after testing your code.
      if (stream.getItemIndex() >= 9) {
        break;
      }
    }
  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  } finally {
    stream.close();
  }

})();
```

## executeFlow(String name, Map inputs, Number timeout)

Runs a flow from a server-side script synchronously.

Execute a flow from within a business rule, script include, or any other server-side
script. Flows run using this method run synchronously. Use startFlow
to run a flow asynchronously.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

Note:This method runs the flow as the user specified in flow
properties.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The scope and name of the flow to be executed, for example<br> `global.flow_name`. |
| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define trigger inputs. Use the input name, not the input<br> label. |
| timeout | Number | Optional. Timeout in milliseconds. This value overrides the 30<br> second default timeout specified by the<br> com.glide.hub.flow\_api.default\_execution\_time system property. After<br> the timeout expires, an exception is thrown. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None | Normal operation produces no return value. |
| Exception | The API throws an exception when a flow called synchronously pauses.<br> `The current execution is in the waiting<br>                    state`. In most cases, the exception is removed when the flow resumes.<br> However, the API cannot resume a flow that has been sent to a MID<br> Server. |

### Example

This uses sn\_fd.FlowAPI.executeFlow to execute a global flow called test\_flow. This
flow is normally triggered when a record on the incident table is updated. Because you are
activating the flow from a script, you must provide this information. The code creates an
inputs variable that contains the current record, and the table for the record. The code is
wrapped in a try/catch statement to capture any errors that might occur when the flow
executes.

```
(function() {
  try {
    var inputs = {};
    inputs['current'] = ; // GlideRecord of table:
    inputs['table_name'] = 'incident';

    // Execute Synchronously: Run in foreground.
    // var timeout = ; //timeout in ms
    //sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeFlow('global.test_flow', inputs, timeout)
    sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeFlow('global.test_flow', inputs);
  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  }
})();
```

```
(function() {

  try {
    var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
    grIncident.get('ed92e8d173d023002728660c4cf6a7bc');

    var inputs = {};
    inputs['current'] = grIncident;
    inputs['table_name'] = 'incident';

    sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeFlowQuick('global.test_quick_flow', inputs);

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
	}

})();
```

## executeSubflow(String name, Map inputs, Number timeout)

Runs an subflow from a server-side script synchronously.

Execute a subflow from within a business rule, script include, or any other server-side
script. Subflows run using this method run synchronously. Use
startSubflow to run an subflow asynchronously.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions.

ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

Note:This method runs the flow as the user specified in flow
properties.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The scope and name of the subflow to be executed, for example<br> `global.subflow_name`. |
| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define subflow inputs. Use the input name, not the input<br> label. |
| timeout | Number | Optional. Timeout in milliseconds. This value overrides the 30<br> second default timeout specified by the<br> com.glide.hub.flow\_api.default\_execution\_time system property. After<br> the timeout expires, an exception is thrown. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Object containing the subflow outputs. |
| Exception | The API throws an exception when a flow called synchronously pauses.<br> `The current execution is in the waiting<br>                    state`. In most cases, the exception is removed when the flow resumes.<br> However, the API cannot resume a flow that has been sent to a MID<br> Server. |

### Example

In this , the script uses sn\_fd.FlowAPI.executeSubflow to execute an subflow called
subflowTest in the global scope. A variable called inputs contains the inputs for the
subflow. In this case, a name and password. The code is wrapped in a try/catch statement to
capture any errors that might occur when the flow executes.

```

(function() {

	try {
		var inputs = {};
		inputs['name'] = ; // String
		inputs['password2'] = ; // Password (2 Way Encrypted)

		// Execute Synchronously: Run in foreground.
		// var timeout = ; //timeout in ms
              //sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeSubflow('global.subflowTest', inputs, timeout)
              var outputs = sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeSubflow('global.subflowTest', inputs);

	}
})();
```

## executeSubflowQuick(String name, Map inputs, Number timeout)

Run a subflow from a server-side script synchronously from the current user session
without creating execution details or other related records. Improve performance by eliminating
record-keeping overhead. Use this API to increase the speed of high-volume processing, for
example multiple executions per second, in a production environment.

Reporting & records generatedThis method does not create execution details and context records, regardless of Workflow Studio settings.Run as userThis method runs the flow as the user who initiates the session. Setting the flow to run

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

  try {
    var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
    grIncident.get('57af7aec73d423002728660c4cf6a71c');

    var inputs = {};
    inputs['variable'] = grIncident;

    var outputs = sn_fd.FlowAPI.executeSubflowQuick('global.test_quick_run_subflow', inputs);

    // Get Outputs:
    // Note: outputs can only be retrieved when executing synchronously.
    var output1 = outputs['output1'];

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
    }

})();
```

## getErrorMessage(String contextId)

Returns the error messages produced by a flow, subflow, or action. This method cannot
return messages from flows, subflows, or actions run with the quick() API.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contextId | String | The sys\_id of the flow, subflow, or action whose error messages you want to<br> get. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| String | The last operation run and the error message it produced. |

### Example

This starts a global subflow called test\_error\_subflow and returns any error
messages it produces. Normally, a single script does not both run a flow and then get its
error messages. Typically, either another script or Workflow Studio would have
already run the flow. The code is wrapped in a try/catch statement to capture any errors
that might occur when the flow executes.

```
(function() {

  try {
    // Gather inputs to call flow
    var inputs = {};
    inputs['ah_task'] = myTaskRecord; // GlideRecord of table: task
    inputs['ah_comment'] ='Test Comment' ; // String

    // Call flow with known errors
    var contextId = sn_fd.FlowAPI.startSubflow('global.test_error_subflow', inputs);

    // Get flow error message
    var errormsg = sn_fd.FlowAPI.getErrorMessage(contextId);
    return errormsg;

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  }
})();

## getOutputs(String contextId)

Returns the outputs of a completed action or subflow.

You can use the return values from either the
startAction()
orstartSubflow()
methods as the contextId parameter.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contextId | String | The sys\_id of the action or subflow whose outputs you want to get. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Object containing the action or subflow outputs. |

### Example

This starts a global subflow called test\_subflow, waits for the flow to finish, and
then gets its output values. Normally, a single script does not both run a flow and then get
its output values. Since a flow may not complete before the getOutputs()
call, this example uses a wait time. Typically, either another script or Workflow Studio would have already run the flow. The code is wrapped in a
try/catch statement to capture any errors that might occur when the flow executes.

```
(function() {

  try {
    // Gather inputs to call flow
    var inputs = {};
    inputs['ah_task'] = myTaskRecord; // GlideRecord of table: task
    inputs['ah_comment'] ='Test Comment' ; // String

    // Call flow
    var contextId = sn_fd.FlowAPI.startSubflow('global.test_subflow', inputs);

    // Wait for the flow to finish running

    // Get flow outputs
    var outputs = sn_fd.FlowAPI.getOutputs(contextId);
    var output1 = outputs['output1'];
    return output1;

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  }
})();
```

## getRunner()

Returns a ScriptableFlowRunner builder object for a flow or action
that you want to run.

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI) | Builder object used to run a Workflow Studio action, flow, or<br> subflow. |

### Example

This runs a flow synchronously.

```

(function() {
  try {

    var inputs = {};

    inputs['sys_id'] = '57af7aec73d423002728660c4cf6a71c';  // Pass the record's sys_id in as input.

    var result = sn_fd.FlowAPI.getRunner()  // Create a ScriptableFlowRunner builder object.
      .action('global.markapproved')        // Run the global scope action named markapproved.
      .inForeground()
      .inDomain('TOP/ACME')                 // Run the action from the TOP/ACME domain.
      .withInputs(inputs)
      .run();                               // Run the action and return a FlowRunnerResult object.

    var contextId = result.getContextId();  // Retrieve the context ID from the result
    var dateRun = result.getDate();
    var domainUsed = result.getDomainId();  // Retrieve the Domain ID from the result.
    var flowName = result.getFlowObjectName();
    var flowObjectType = result.getFlowObjectType();

    var outputs = result.getOutputs();            // Retrieve any outputs from the action execution.
    var newApprovalStatus = outputs['approval'];  // Echo back the approval status for verification.

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  }

})();

```

## hasApprovals(String scopedFlowName)

Checks if a flow within a give scope contains any Ask for Approval actions.

The hasApprovals() method determines if a flow within a given scope
contains any Ask for Approval actions. This method also checks if any Ask for Approval
actions within the flow are nested under If flow logic blocks. For more information, see
Ask for Approval actions.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| scopedFlowName | String | Scope and internal name of the flow to execute. For example,<br> `global.flow_name`. Locate the Internal name<br> field in the list of Workflow Studio flows. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| String | Returns one of the following string values:<br>- ALWAYS: The flow contains an Ask for Approval action that isn't nested within<br>   a conditional `If` flow logic block.<br>- CONDITIONALLY: The flow contains an Ask for Approval action that is nested<br>   within a conditional `If` flow logic block.<br>- NO: The flow doesn't contain any Ask for Approval actions.<br>- UNKNOWN: There was a compiler error, and the system can't determine whether<br>   the flow contains any Ask for Approval actions. |

### Example

The following checks if the example\_flow flow within the
global scope contains any Ask for Approval actions and logs the result.

```
(function() {

  try {
    var result = sn_fd.FlowAPI.hasApprovals('global.example_flow');
    gs.log('Result: ' + result);
  }

  catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  }
})();
```

## restartFlowFromContext(String ContextId, Map providedInputs)

Restarts a flow,
subflow, or action that was run in the background. You can provide new inputs or
omit them to reuse the previously provided inputs.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contextId | String | The sys\_id of the flow, subflow, or action you want to restart. This flow, subflow, or action must have run in background and have an associated sysevent record. |
| providedInputs | Object | Optional. Map object containing the name-value pairs that define replacement<br> inputs for the flow, subflow, or action. If you omit or provide a null value for<br> this parameter, the flow, subflow, or action runs using the previously provided<br> inputs. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ScriptableFlowRunnerResultsScoped | Object containing the execution details of a Workflow Studio<br> action, flow, or subflow. |

### Example

Restarts a sample flow that has a record-based trigger on the Incident table. The original
flow used sample incident INC0008112 as an input. When the flow restarts it instead uses
sample incident INC0008111 as an input.

```
(function() {
  try {

    var flowContextID = '4216396ffd7d11107edcf07204c30fd5';     // sys_id of sys_flow_context record
    var oldIncidentRecord = '552c48888c033300964f4932b03eb092'; // sys_id of INC0008112
    var newIncidentRecord = 'a83820b58f723300e7e16c7827bdeed2'; // sys_id of INC0008111
    var inputs = {};
    var gr = new GlideRecord('incident'); // Create new incident object

    gr.get(newIncidentRecord);            // Get GlideRecord object for INC0008111

    inputs['current'] = gr;               // Set new Incident record as input
    inputs['table_name'] = 'incident';    // Set table name to Incident

    var result = sn_fd.FlowAPI.getRunner()            // Create a ScriptableFlowRunner builder object.
      .restartFlowFromContext(flowContextID, inputs); // Restart flow with new inputs.

    var contextId = result.getContextId();  // Retrieve the context ID from the result
    var dateRun = result.getDate();

    gs.info(contextId + ' ' + dateRun);

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  }

})();
```

## scheduleCancel(String contextId, String reason, Integer delaySeconds)

Schedule a system event in the
Flow Engine Queue to cancel a flow that is in the in progress, presumed
interrupted, or waiting state after a delay.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contextId | String | Sys\_id of the execution details record for the flow, subflow, or action. The<br> target flow, subflow, or action must be in the in progress, presumed interrupted, or<br> waiting state. Access the execution details by navigating to the Flow Executions tab<br> in Workflow Studio, or pass the sys\_id of the context record returned<br> by the method.<br>Note: There might be a small delay in cancellation if<br>the target context is running on a different node of the instance. Contexts running on the<br>same node are cancelled immediately. Contexts running on another node must first wait for<br>the cancellation to be forwarded to the appropriate node. |
| reason | String | Reason for canceling the flow, subflow, or action. Appears in the<br> Message field of the Flow engine log entries \[sys\_flow\_log\]<br> table. |
| delaySeconds | Integer | Optional. Number of seconds to wait before processing a cancellation event in the<br> Flow Engine Queue. If you omit this parameter, the method uses the default value of<br> 1 second.<br>You can use this parameter to avoid the performance impact of scheduling<br>the cancellation of thousands of flow contexts at the same time. Rather than run<br>all cancellations simultaneously, schedule a batch of flow cancellations with a<br>delay. Alternatively, you could use the delay as a time out value for an<br>asynchronous flow. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None |  |

### Example

This uses the return value of the startFlow() method to schedule
the cancellation of any long-running flows.

```
(function() {

var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
now_GR.addQuery('number', 'INC0000050');
now_GR.query();
now_GR.next();

      try {
          var inputs = {};
          inputs['current'] = now_GR; // GlideRecord of table:
          inputs['table_name'] = 'incident';

          // Starts the flow asynchronously.
          var contextId = sn_fd.FlowAPI.startFlow('global.myFlow', inputs);

      } catch (ex) {
          var message = ex.getMessage();
          gs.error(message);
      }
})();


// Call the scheduleCancel() method using the context Id returned from the startFlow() method
sn_fd.FlowAPI.scheduleCancel(contextId, 'Flow took too long to execute.', 60);
```

### Example

This schedules the cancellation of any flows named Test Flow.

```
var now_GR = new GlideRecord("sys_flow_context");
now_GR.addQuery("name", "Test Flow");
now_GR.query();

while (now_GR.next()) {
sn_fd.FlowAPI.scheduleCancel(now_GR.getUniqueValue(), 'Canceling Test Flows', 60);
}
```

### Example

This uses the delaySeconds parameter to run flow cancellation jobs in batches. Use
batches to cancel thousands of flow contexts.

```
var delaySeconds = 1;

for (var i; i < sys_flow_context.length; ++i) {
  if (i % 100 === 0) {
    delaySeconds = delaySeconds + 60;
  }
  var contextId = sys_flow_context[i];
  var reason = "Example reason";
  sn_fd.FlowAPI.scheduleCancel(contextId, reason, delaySeconds);
}
```

## sendMessage(String contextSysID, String message, String payload)

Send a specific message and payload response to a flow that is paused and waiting for a message.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| contextSysID | String | The sys\_id value of the flow or subflow that is paused and waiting for a specific message to resume. The flow or subflow must include a Wait for Message action. See Wait For Message action. |
| message | String | The text string to send to the waiting flow or subflow. If this message value matches the message value listed in the Wait for Message action, then the flow or subflow resumes running. See Wait For Message action. |
| payload | String | The text string output value to send to the waiting flow. The flow or subflow can use the payload as an input when it resumes running. For example, you could specify a reason why a record was reopened or that a new<br> approval was required. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None |  |

### Example

This sends the message `Resume Flow` to restart a paused flow. The paused flow can then use the payload value as data elsewhere in the flow.

```
(function() {
    try {
      // var change = '154a6320db9b12102166e229139619fc';    // Example sys_id of change record
      var pausedFlowId = '6e9bab60949b1210dda11cd237cd955d'; // Example sys_id of a paused flow
      var resumeMessage = 'Resume Flow';                     // Message that paused flow is waiting for
      var payload = 'Resubmitted for approval';              // Data to send back to flow
      var result = sn_fd.FlowAPI
      .sendMessage(pausedFlowId, resumeMessage, payload);    // Send a message to the paused flow
    } catch (ex) {
      var message = ex.getMessage();
      gs.error(message);
    }
  })();

```

## setEncryptedOutput(String password)

Builds password2 values inside a script step.

Identify an encrypted password2 value returned from a GlideRecord, enabling the system to
display the value as a masked password rather than an encrypted string.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| password | String | Encrypted password2 value. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| String | Encrypted password2 value, recognised by the engine as a password<br> value. |

### Example

This returns value of a password2 field from a user record and stores in in a
variable. This variable is passed into the setEncryptedOutput method, which is called using
sn\_fd.GlideActionUtil.setEncryptedOutput. The instance recognises the returned value as a
password.

```
(function execute(inputs, outputs) {
  // ...code...
  var now_GR = new GlideRecord('sys_user');
  now_GR.addQuery('first_name' , 'Abel');
  now_GR.query();
  now_GR.next();
  var pwVal = now_GR.getValue('pw2');
  outputs['usedSetEncrypted'] = sn_fd.GlideActionUtil.setEncryptedOutput(pwVal);
  outputs['justSetDirectly'] = pwVal;
})(inputs, outputs);
```

## startAction(String name, Map inputs)

Runs an action from a server-side script asynchronously.

Execute an action from within a business rule, script include, or any other server-side
script. Actions run using this method run asynchronously, so scripts using this method do
not have access to any outputs created by the action. Use
executeAction to run an action synchronously and access the outputs
it generates.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

Note:This method runs the action as the user who initiates
the session.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The scope and name of the action to be executed, for example<br> `global.action_name`. |
| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define action inputs. Use the input name, not the input<br> label. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| String | Sys Id of the context record for the action. Access the context record by<br> navigating to the Flow Executions tab in Workflow Studio, selecting a<br> flow execution, and clicking Open Context Record. |

### Example

This uses sn\_fd.FlowAPI.startAction to execute an action called add\_comment in the
sn\_itsm\_spoke scope. The inputs object contains a target record and a comment to add to that
record. The code is wrapped in a try/catch statement to capture any errors that might occur
when the flow executes.

```
(function() {
  try {
    var inputs = {};
    inputs['ah_task'] = myTaskRecord; // GlideRecord of table: task
    inputs['ah_comment'] ='Test Comment' ; // String

    var contextId = sn_fd.FlowAPI.startAction('sn_itsm_spoke.add_comment', inputs);

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  }
})();
```

## startActionQuick(String name, Map inputs)

Runs an action from a server-side script asynchronously without creating execution
details or other related records. Improve performance by eliminating record-keeping overhead.
Use this API to increase the speed of high-volume processing, for
example multiple executions per second, in a production environment.

Reporting & records generatedThis method does not create execution details and context records, regardless of Workflow Studio settings.Wait supportThis method does not support pausing the action to wait
for conditions. Steps that pause for wait conditions such as Ask for Approval or Wait
for Condition are not supported.MID Server supportThis method does not support pausing an action to run from a MID Server.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | Scope and internal name of the action to execute. For example,<br> `global.action_name`. Locate the Internal<br> name field in the list of Workflow Studio<br> actions. |
| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define action inputs. You can find the available action<br> inputs and required data types under Inputs in the action outline. Use the input<br> name, not the input label. For example,<br> `{'table':'incident','sys_id':'a39d8e3cf0212300964feeefe80ff0ed'}`. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| void | Method does not return a value |

### Example

```
(function() {

  try {
    var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
    grIncident.get('57af7aec73d423002728660c4cf6a71c');

    var inputs = {};
    inputs['variable'] = grIncident;

    sn_fd.FlowAPI.startActionQuick('global.update_record_test', inputs);

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
    }

})();
```

## startFlow(String name, Map inputs)

Runs a flow from a server-side script.

Execute a flow from within a business rule, script include, or any other server-side
script. Flows executed with this method run asynchronously.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

Note:This method runs the flow as the user specified in flow
properties.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The scope and name of the flow to be executed, for example<br> `global.flow_name`. |
| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define trigger inputs. Use the input name, not the input<br> label. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| String | Sys Id of the context record for the flow. Access the context record by<br> navigating to the Flow Executions tab in Workflow Studio, selecting a<br> flow execution, and clicking Open Context Record. |

### Example

This uses sn\_fd.FlowAPI.startFlow to execute a global flow called test\_flow. The
code creates an inputs variable that contains inputs required by the flow. In this case, the
current record and the table for the record. The code is wrapped in a try/catch statement to
capture any errors that might occur when the flow executes.

```
(function() {

  var now_GR = new GlideRecord('incident');
  now_GR.addQuery('number', 'INC0009009');
  now_GR.query();
  now_GR.next();

  try {
    var inputs = {};
    inputs['current'] = now_GR; // GlideRecord of table: Incident
    inputs['table_name'] = 'incident';

    var contextId = sn_fd.FlowAPI.startFlow('global.test_flow', inputs);

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
  }
})();
```

## startFlowQuick(String name, Map inputs)

Runs a flow from a server-side script asynchronously without creating execution details
or other related records. Improve performance by eliminating record-keeping overhead. Use this API to increase the speed of high-volume processing, for
example multiple executions per second, in a production environment.

Reporting & records generatedThis method does not create execution details and context records, regardless of Workflow Studio settings.Run as System userThis method runs the flow as the System user. Setting the flow to run as the user who
initiates the session, or impersonating a user, is not supported.Wait supportThis method does not support pausing the flow to wait for conditions. Actions or flow
logic that pause for wait conditions such as Ask for Approval, Wait for Condition, or Wait
for a duration are not supported.MID Server supportThis method does not support pausing a flow to run from a MID Server.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions. Use the getRunner() method in the FlowAPI class to return a ScriptableFlowRunner object and use the associated methods. Use the
ScriptableFlowRunner methods if you need to support domain separation.

**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | Scope and internal name of the flow to execute. For example,<br> `global.flow_name`. Locate the Internal name<br> field in the list of Workflow Studio<br> flows. |
| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define trigger inputs. You can find the available trigger<br> inputs and required data types in the Trigger section of the flow. Use the input<br> name, not the input label. For example,<br> `{'table':'incident','sys_id':'a39d8e3cf0212300964feeefe80ff0ed'}`. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| void | Method does not return a value |

### Example

```
(function() {

  try {
    var grIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');
    grIncident.get('ed92e8d173d023002728660c4cf6a7bc');

    var inputs = {};
    inputs['current'] = grIncident;
    inputs['table_name'] = 'incident';

    sn_fd.FlowAPI.startFlowQuick('global.test_quick_flow', inputs);

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
    gs.error(message);
	}

})();
```

## startSubflow(String name, Map input)

Runs a subflow from a server-side script.

Execute a subflow from within a business rule, script include, or any other server-side
script. Subflows run using this method run asynchronously Scripts that include this method
do not have access to outputs created by the flow. Use executeSubflow
to run a subflow synchronously and access the outputs it generates.

Note:This API is replaced by [ScriptableFlowRunner](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/zurich/server/ScriptableFlowRunnerScopedAPI), which deprecates the existing methods used to build objects and execute Workflow Studio flows and actions.

| inputs | Map | Name-value pairs that define subflow inputs. Use the input name, not the input<br> label. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| String | Sys Id of the context record for the subflow. Access the context record by<br> navigating to the Flow Executions tab in Workflow Studio, selecting a<br> flow execution, and clicking Open Context Record. |

### Example

This uses sn\_fd.FlowAPI.startSubflow to execute a global flow
called test\_subflow. The code is wrapped in a try/catch statement to capture any errors that
might occur when the flow executes.

```
(function() {

    var inputs = {};
    inputs['ah_task'] = myTaskRecord; // GlideRecord of table: task
    inputs['ah_comment'] ='Test Comment' ; // String

    var contextId = sn_fd.FlowAPI.startSubflow('global.test_subflow', inputs);

  } catch (ex) {
    var message = ex.getMessage();
